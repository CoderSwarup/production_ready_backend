## Introduction to Subscription Model

The Subscription Model is a crucial aspect of a production-level backend project. It involves the relationship between subscribers and channels. In the context of the provided code snippet, a subscriber and a channel are both represented by a User.

### Code Implementation

```js
import mongoose, { Schema } from "mongoose";

const subscriptionSchema = new Schema(
  {
    subscriber: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
    },
    channel: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

export const Subscription = mongoose.model("Subscription", subscriptionSchema);
```

The schema defines two main entities - subscriber and channel, both represented by the "User" schema.

# Data Storage in the Model

Assuming the user list includes: a, b, c, and the channel list includes: HC, COC, FCC, the documents are created for each new subscriber:

```plaintext

{
    subscriber: ObjectID('a'),
    channel: ObjectID('HC')
}

{
    subscriber: ObjectID('b'),
    channel: ObjectID('COC')
}

{
    subscriber: ObjectID('c'),
    channel: ObjectID('FCC')
}

{
    subscriber: ObjectID('a'),
    channel: ObjectID('COC')
}

{
    subscriber: ObjectID('a'),
    channel: ObjectID('FCC')
}

```

# Benefits

## 1. Find Subscribers of a Channel

To retrieve the subscribers of a particular channel, use the following command:

```js
Subscription.find({ channel: ObjectId(Channel) });
```

This will return all documents representing subscribers of the specified channel.

## 2. Find the Channels Subscribed by a User

To get the list of channels subscribed by any user, use the following query:

```js
Subscription.find({ subscriber: ObjectId(Channel) });
```

This will Return all the channels that Subcribe by the User
