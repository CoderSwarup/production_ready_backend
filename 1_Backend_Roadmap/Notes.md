## What is Backend?

The backend is the server-side of a website, responsible for storing and managing data and ensuring the functionality of the client-side. It's the hidden part of a website that users don't directly interact with. Backend developers work on creating APIs, libraries, and handling system components without user interfaces. It plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of web applications.

## Step 1: Learn a Programming Language

Selecting the right programming language is a fundamental step in your backend development journey. Here are some popular languages used for backend development:

<div>
   <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Language</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Framework Documentation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Python</td>
            <td>Known for its simplicity and versatility.</td>
            <td><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/">Django</a>: A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Flask is another lightweight option.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Node.js</td>
            <td>Uses JavaScript for server-side scripting.</td>
            <td><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.</td>

## Step 2: Learn a Database

Databases are essential for storing and managing data. You should choose a database system that suits your project requirements. Here are some common databases:

<div>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Database</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>ORM Solution</th>
            <th>ODM Solution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MySQL</td>
            <td>An open-source relational database management system.</td>
            <td><a href="https://sequelize.org/">Sequelize</a>: A popular ORM for Node.js, providing support for MySQL and other SQL databases.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PostgreSQL</td>
            <td>Highly extensible and powerful open-source database.</td>
            <td><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/">Django ORM</a>: Built into Django, it provides ORM support for PostgreSQL and other relational databases.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MongoDB</td>
            <td>A NoSQL database for unstructured data.</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td><a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a>: An ODM for Node.js, designed for MongoDB, making it easy to work with unstructured data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SQLite</td>
            <td>A lightweight, serverless, and self-contained DB.</td>
            <td><a href="https://sequelize.org/">Sequelize</a>: Similar to MySQL, Sequelize supports SQLite as well.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Redis</td>
            <td>An in-memory data structure store for caching.</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** ORM solutions provide a bridge between object-oriented programming and relational databases, allowing you to interact with the database using objects and classes.

- **ODM (Object-Document Mapping):** ODM solutions are tailored for NoSQL databases, specifically document-oriented databases like MongoDB. They facilitate the interaction with semi-structured data stored in documents.

You can choose the appropriate ORM or ODM solution based on the database system you are using and the programming language you prefer.

# ORM and ODM

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

ORM, which stands for Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique used in software development to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases. In simpler terms, it allows developers to interact with a database using object-oriented programming languages, like Java, Python, or C#, rather than writing raw SQL queries. ORM frameworks provide a set of APIs and tools to map objects in the application code to database tables and vice versa.

Benefits of ORM:

- **Abstraction:** ORM abstracts the database operations, making it easier for developers to work with databases without dealing with the intricacies of SQL.
- **Database Portability:** It enables applications to work with different database management systems (DBMS) with minimal code changes.
- **Simplified Code:** ORM can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, as it reduces the need for handwritten SQL queries.
- **Object-Oriented Approach:** It allows developers to work with data in a more natural, object-oriented manner.

Popular ORM frameworks for various programming languages include Hibernate (Java), SQLAlchemy (Python), Entity Framework (C#), and Sequelize (JavaScript).

## ODM (Object-Document Mapping)

ODM, which stands for Object-Document Mapping, is a similar concept to ORM, but it is used in the context of NoSQL databases, specifically document-oriented databases. Document databases, like MongoDB, store data in a semi-structured format, typically in JSON-like documents. ODM frameworks provide a way to interact with these NoSQL databases using the principles of object-oriented programming.

Benefits of ODM:

- **Schema Flexibility:** NoSQL databases allow for flexible and dynamic schemas, making ODM an ideal choice for such databases.
- **Native Data Types:** ODM libraries provide native support for the data types used by the document database, such as embedded arrays and objects.
- **Complex Queries:** They offer tools to build complex queries and aggregations tailored to the database's capabilities.
- **Scalability:** ODM frameworks are well-suited for building scalable applications that work with NoSQL databases.

Popular ODM frameworks include Mongoose (for MongoDB in JavaScript/Node.js) and Morphia (for MongoDB in Java).

In summary, ORM and ODM are essential tools for developers to work efficiently with relational and document databases, respectively. They abstract the complexities of interacting with databases, allowing developers to focus on application logic and data modeling.

## JavaScript Based Backed

## Features

- **Data Handling:** The backend is responsible for managing and processing data efficiently.

- **File Handling:** It provides mechanisms for handling files, such as uploading, storing, and serving files.

- **Third-Party APIs:** Integration with third-party APIs to fetch or send data to external services.

# JavaScript Runtime Environments

A JavaScript runtime environment is a platform for running JavaScript code. Here are some common JavaScript runtime environments:

1. **Web Browsers:** These are used for client-side web development. Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have built-in JavaScript engines for interpreting and executing JavaScript code in web pages.

2. **Node.js:** Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server, making it suitable for building server-side applications, APIs, and command-line tools.

3. **Deno:** Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It comes with a set of built-in tools and modules for various tasks and emphasizes security and simplicity.

4. **Electron:** Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies, including JavaScript. It provides a runtime environment for JavaScript within desktop applications.

5. **Mobile App Development:** JavaScript is also used for mobile app development using frameworks like React Native and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap). These frameworks allow developers to write mobile applications using JavaScript.

6. **Embedded Systems:** JavaScript can be used in embedded systems, including microcontrollers and IoT devices, through runtime environments like Espruino and JerryScript.

These runtime environments enable developers to leverage the versatility of JavaScript for a wide range of applications, from web development to server-side programming, desktop applications, and even IoT devices.
