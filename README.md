# üöÄ Production-Level Backend Development with JavaScript

Welcome to the journey of becoming a production-level backend developer using JavaScript! I'm Swarup Bhise, a passionate web developer always eager to learn new skills and explore cutting-edge technologies.

# üí´ Special Thank's

A special thanks to [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) for the excellent tutorials on backend development using JavaScript. You can find the tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoBGh_8p_NS-ZAh6v7HhYqHW) and the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/chai-backend).

## üìñ Summary of this project

This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have. We are building a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. We have spent a lot of time in building this project and we are sure that you will learn a lot from this project.
